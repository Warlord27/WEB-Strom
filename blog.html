            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"> Windows has always been about enabling you to work and play your way. And what makes Windows, well, Windows, is the variety of apps available to let you do just that. Since the launch of Windows 11, the Microsoft Store has attracted more creators and users around the world; today we are adding over 1,000 more apps and games in partnership with the Amazon Appstore. Windows 11 users in the U.S. can access the Amazon Appstore Preview1&nbsp;in the Microsoft Store, and popular apps like Audible, Kindle, Subway Surfers, Lords Mobile, Khan Academy Kids and many more. This experience, built on the AndroidTM&nbsp;platform and supported by Intel® Bridge Technology, introduces a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/abed2335-81bf-490a-92e5-fe01b66e5c48" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-1">new category of mobile apps and games available for Windows</a>.To get started with the preview,&nbsp;<a href="ms-windows-store://downloadsandupdates/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-2">open and update the Microsoft Store</a>&nbsp;(click Get updates in Microsoft Store &gt; Library) – search your favorite titles or explore our new curated collection of mobile apps and games; when you’ve found what you’re looking for, download them through the Amazon Appstore.1&nbsp;These apps feel like a part of Windows, integrating naturally with Windows input and windowing experiences, like Snap layouts.Today’s preview&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-3">reinforces our commitment</a>&nbsp;to be the most open platform for creators, and we look forward to sharing more details later this year on how we’ll broaden availability with the Amazon Appstore. We can’t wait to hear your feedback on the experience.New enhancements to the TaskbarThe Taskbar is an ever-present launch point for everything we do on our PCs. That’s why we’re continuing to invest in experiences that make it easier to see all the information you need now and take action directly, no matter how many screens you’re working from. These new Taskbar enhancements are initially available in the February 2022 non-security preview release.Mute/unmute &amp; share any window from the TaskbarIn our hybrid world, the time spent connecting through video conferencing continues to rise. Phrases like “You’re on mute” or “Can you see my slides?” have become common things we say or hear throughout our day, and we want to help change that. Mute/unmute and share any window from the Taskbar are designed to make it easier for you to take quick actions and have confidence that you are at your best while on video calls. Instantly accessible from your Taskbar, window sharing and mute controls are available to Microsoft Teams users with a work or school account.

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate did not properly limit the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.This issue has been assigned CVE-2022-24713. The severity of this vulnerability is "high" when the&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate are not affected by this vulnerability.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Overview&nbsp;</span>The&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes.Affected versionsAll versions of the&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue.&nbsp;<br>The fix is included starting from&nbsp;regex&nbsp;1.5.5.MitigationsWe recommend everyone accepting user-controlled regexes to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the&nbsp;regex&nbsp;crate.Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, we do not recommend denying known problematic regexes.AcknowledgementsWe want to thank Addison Crump for responsibly disclosing this to us according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-1">Rust security policy</a>, and for helping review the fix.We also want to thank Andrew Gallant for developing the fix, and Pietro Albini for coordinating the disclosure and writing this advisory.

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Programming Languages of the Future</span> Software developers and other computer-related professionals need to be aware of the current top programming languages. Programming is what runs all of society’s machines; everything from smartphones to traffic lights to heart monitors are programmed with computer languages. Learning and using programming languages is an essential part of a software developer’s job.The programming languages of the future are Go, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, R, Scala, Swift, Rust, Ruby, and Haskell,as reported by TechRepublic. Proficiency or advanced skills in these programming languages would elevate a professional’s technical abilities and potentially open up more opportunities when looking for jobs.While highly sought after by employers, some of the programming languages are actually pretty obscure. For example, &nbsp;Go and Scala are among the highest-paying programming languages due to the small number of qualified professionals specializing in each language. Go is defined in a Forbes article as an “open-source compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of C” while Scala is a “general-purpose, functional, and object-oriented language compatible with Java.” Go was designed at Google and is used not only there, but also at Adobe and Facebook. Meanwhile, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Twitter use Scala.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cross-Platform Development&nbsp;</span>As technology has progressed, so have the devices people use to connect to the world, like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even smartwatches. Each of those products has software developed for it. Companies want to place their apps on as many platforms and devices as possible, and thus programmers need to choose the right language for developing across multiple platforms.The demand for cross-platform development is high and getting higher. Forrester reports that over 60 percent of companies already use cross-platform development, and that number is expected to increase due to device proliferation. According to TechBeacon.com, programmers need to become well-versed in cross-development applications: Adobe, Xamarin, Appcelerator, iFactr, Kony, SAP, Alpha, 5app, FeedHenry, and Sencha.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </span>The future of programming also includes artificial intelligence (AI). Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) research reveals that 12 percent of companies use AI-based security analytics extensively while 27 percent use AI-based security analytics on a limited basis. AI integration is poised to completely change the IT and computer industries, as AI becomes increasingly capable of dealing with incident detection, prioritizations, remediations, software vulnerabilities, threat intelligence, and risk assessment.Programmers can use AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, to develop software for network security. As time goes on and technology evolves to such an advanced degree, AI may be the only realistic way to deal with the consequent cybersecurity threats. These concerns are why the tech industry is hiring professionals with advanced AI technology knowledge to protect its company assets.According to an ESG article, machine learning technologies can be either “applied to existing security defenses as helper apps” or “work on a stand-alone basis coupled with other security and analytics technologies.” To stay ahead of the big changes AI will bring, programmers and developers need to ensure that they have the skills necessary for success, such as knowledge of AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity analytics.

Since 2018, Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-1">exploreCSR</a>&nbsp;awards have aided higher education efforts that support students interested in pursuing graduate studies and research careers in computing.The TensorFlow team is proud to provide additional funding to support this important program. To date, we have awarded more than 20 professors with funding to support their education and outreach work in machine learning.We’d like to highlight examples of the many (and often, unique) outreach programs the 2021 award recipients have created so far. These range from research experiences with robotics, aquatic vehicles, federated learning, and offline digital libraries to mentored small group workshops on data science and programming skills. They’re sorted alphabetically by university below.If you’re interested in creating your own programs like these with support from Google, keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-2">exploreCSR</a>&nbsp;website for the next round of applications opening in June 2022.Laura Hosman and Courtney Finkbeiner, Arizona State UniversityThe&nbsp;<a href="https://solarspell.org/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-3">SolarSPELL</a>&nbsp;initiative at Arizona State University will host a workshop series thanks to support from exploreCSR to encourage students underrepresented in computer science research in their academic journey. The SolarSPELL initiative produces an offline, solar-powered digital library designed to bring educational content to resource-constrained locations that may lack electricity, internet connectivity, and/or traditional libraries.The exploreCSR workshop series, titled “SolarSPELL exploreCSR: Computing for Good”, involves 6 weeks of sessions using SolarSPELL as a case study for how students can apply machine learning to tackle real-world problems and develop solutions for social good. Students will meet SolarSPELL’s co-director and learn about the history of the SolarSPELL initiative; learn about graduate programs available at ASU; and hear from guest panelists from industry.

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> 6 tech recruiting trends for 2022Recruiters, we’ve got you covered. Here are the tech recruiting trends that will change the way you build tech teams in 2022.<br>Data-driven recruiting<br>Data-driven recruiting strategies are the answer to effective talent sourcing and a streamlined hiring process.Talent acquisition leaders need to use real-time analytics like pipeline growth metrics, offer acceptance rates (by team, department, and location), quality and cost of new hires, and candidate feedback scores—to help them reduce/eliminate manual work, improve in critical areas and hire the best talent.The key to capitalizing on talent market trends in 2022 is data. It will help you to analyze what’s working and what needs to be tweaked leaving you room for experimentation.Employer branding and EVP<br>98% of recruiters believe promoting company culture helps sourcing efforts as seen in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/recruit/resources/insights/drs2021/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-1">2021 State Of Developer Recruitment</a>&nbsp;report. Having a strong employer brand that supports an equally strong Employer Value Proposition (EVP) is crucial to swaying candidates’ decision to work at your company.As recruiters, you have to evaluate what your culture stands for and how candidates can be successful at the workplace. You have to be specific about what EVPs you are offering. Perks like upskilling opportunities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/talent-assessment/remote-onboarding-tips/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-2">remote work processes</a>, flexible working hours are some of the top EVPs that attract qualified candidates.A clear, well-outlined EVP builds a healthier company culture, which includes better work-life balance, prioritizes mental health, and encourages remote/hybrid work. This in turn strengthens your employer brand as these policies are candidate-friendly and put them first.Candidate driven market<br>Katrina Collier, HR and Recruitment facilitator, said in her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ta-stop-acting-like-service-function-katrina-collier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-3">newsletter</a>&nbsp;that 2021 was the most candidate-driven market she had ever seen in her 18+ years of career. And she’s got it right.The pandemic drastically increased the skills gap and recruiting tech talent has become an uphill struggle With the severe shortage of tech talent, candidates hold more power in choosing whom to work with—they can afford to be picky.Simply dangling a competitive pay package will not cut it anymore. Utilize data-driven recruiting to find out what candidates look for in an ideal job role. Is it work-life balance, a healthy company culture, remote work options, or investment in learning and development?Recruiters and hiring managers need to get creative to stand out from the crowd and attract the cream of the crop.Recommended read:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/talent-assessment/tech-hiring-challenges/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-4">What NOT To Do When Recruiting Fresh Talent</a>Diversity, equity, and inclusion<br>Fairer representation and inclusion in the tech industry throughout the world have come to the forefront in the last few years. It has become a key focus of modern recruitment.While our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/recruit/resources/insights/drs2021/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-5">survey</a>&nbsp;shows us that D&amp;I may have to take a backseat at times to quickly fill open positions—25.6% of our HR respondents believe having a diverse executive team, and improving connections with grassroots student communities can improve their diversity pipeline and fend off biases.This is further supported by the fact that above-average profitability is 25% higher for companies in the top-quartile for gender diversity in leadership and 36% higher for those with ethnic diversity as seen in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-6">McKinsey’s Diversity Wins</a>&nbsp;report.Recruiters have also experienced candidates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jobvite.com/lp/2021-recruiter-nation-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-7">turn down job roles</a>&nbsp;due to a lack of DEI representation at the workplace.

They don’t receive proper communication or extremely delayed updates, they don’t know how they’re progressing in different stages of the hiring process, and they don’t get much feedback on how they performed in the interviews.Looking at it from a recruiter’s perspective, regular communication with the candidates is one of the most difficult parts of their job. Manually emailing prospects to nurture them or keeping a large number of candidates in the loop is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not sustainable.In 2022 and beyond, recruitment automation trends like automated nurturing and AI for recruiting platforms are what will both eliminate the needless complexity and inefficiency of manual communications and ensure you personalize your team’s candidate outreach. This serves to provide a positive candidate-first experience as well.Remote recruiting and hiring<br>The future of work is mostly remote/hybrid. Remote work has mandated that tech hiring become a more collaborative process, and accelerated the adoption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/others/assess-programming-skills/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-9">tech recruiting platforms</a>.

And that should translate into remote hiring practices. More and more candidates are expecting remote work and remote hiring processes.Remote recruitment saves time, expenses and increases efficiency while also opening the doors to a larger talent pool not limited by geography.Recruiting Tech Talent Just Got Easier With HackerEarth&nbsp;Recruiting tech talent that is qualified is complicated.
